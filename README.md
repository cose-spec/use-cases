# COSE use-cases

This repository can be used for collecting use cases for the COSE
spec.
It currently contains a single document, [use-cases.md](https://github.com/cose-spec/use-cases/blob/master/use-cases.md).

To raise an issue about use cases, please send mail to [cose@ietf.org](mailto:cose@ietf.org?Subject=Use%20cases)
Alternately, you can fork and submit pull requests, but unless minor editorial these will need to be reflected on the mailing list anyway.
